# AI Voice Bot

A real-time voice conversation bot built with Pipecat that can handle phone calls via Daily. 

The bot uses Deepgram for STT (possibly unimplemented), Claude for conversation intelligence and ElevenLabs for voice synthesis.

ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key  # INCOMPLETE
CANONICAL_API_KEY=your_canonical_api_key  # INCOMPLETE
```

#### 🚀 Local Development

1. Start the server from the src directory:
```bash
python src/server.py
```

2. The server will start on `http://localhost:7860`

3. Visit bots.daily.co and get a phone number, you could also do this programmatically at these endpoints:
    - https://api.daily.co/v1/list-available-numbers?region=WA&city=Seattle
    - https://api.daily.co/v1/buy-phone-number
    - https://api.daily.co/v1/purchased-phone-numbers

    Documentation: https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/phone-numbers

4. Set up ngrok to point to your localhost, exposing the port to Daily's webhook:
```bash
ngrok http localhost:7860
```

5. Configure the phone number to point to the ngrok url with the FastAPI slug to start the server ("/daily_start_bot")

6. Watch it break, beacuse its not done yet 🐒 🦧
