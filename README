# AI Voice Bot & AI Structured Data Extraction

A real-time voice conversation bot built with Pipecat that can handle phone calls via Daily. 

The bot uses Deepgram for STT (possibly unimplemented), Claude for conversation intelligence and ElevenLabs for voice synthesis.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Docker (optional) (INCOMPLETE)
- API Keys:
  - Daily.co account and API key
  - Deepgram API key (INCOMPLETE)
  - ElevenLabs API key 
  - ElevenLabs voice ID
  - Anthropic API key
  - Canonical API key (optional, for metrics) (INCOMPLETE)

### 🛠️ Installation

#### 📥 Local Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone -b pipecat https://github.com/David-Botos/BearHug.git
cd BearHug
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv env
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
# On Unix/macOS
source env/bin/activate

# On Windows (havent tested this)
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
DAILY_API_KEY=your_daily_api_key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key  # INCOMPLETE
CANONICAL_API_KEY=your_canonical_api_key  # INCOMPLETE
```

#### 🚀 Local Development

1. Start the server from the src directory:
```bash
python src/server.py
```

2. The server will start on `http://localhost:7860`

3. Visit bots.daily.co and get a phone number, you could also do this programmatically at these endpoints:
    - https://api.daily.co/v1/list-available-numbers?region=WA&city=Seattle
    - https://api.daily.co/v1/buy-phone-number
    - https://api.daily.co/v1/purchased-phone-numbers

    Documentation: https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/phone-numbers

4. Set up ngrok to point to your localhost, exposing the port to Daily's webhook:
```bash
ngrok http localhost:7860
```

5. Configure the phone number to point to the ngrok url with the FastAPI slug to start the server ("/daily_start_bot")

6. Watch it break, beacuse its not done yet 🐒 🦧
