This repo is a demo that shows off the capabilities of an AI voice agent to extract important information about latent capacity in CBOs in Seattle.  The idea is to evolve this project into a tool that helps badass social workers.

## Getting Started
First, install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:
```bash

```
